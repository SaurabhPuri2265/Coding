Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

Given binary search tree:  root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5]

class Solution {
    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        
        
        if(root.val>=p.val && root.val<=q.val || root.val>=q.val && root.val<=p.val)
            return root;
        
        if(root.val>p.val && root.val>q.val)
            return lowestCommonAncestor(root.left,p,q);
        
        return lowestCommonAncestor(root.right,p,q);
    }
}
