Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters(can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters. (eg, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not). A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

 

If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
Output: 3  
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.

class Solution {
    public int longestCommonSubsequence(String text1, String text2) {
        int m=text1.length();
        int n=text2.length();
        
        int res[][]=new int[m+1][n+1];
        
        for(int i=0;i<m;i++)
            res[i][0]=0;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
            res[0][i]=0;
        
        for(int i=1;i<=m;i++)
            for(int j=1;j<=n;j++)
            {
                if(text1.charAt(i-1)==text2.charAt(j-1))
                    res[i][j]=res[i-1][j-1]+1;
                else 
                    res[i][j]=Math.max(res[i-1][j],res[i][j-1]);
            }
        
        return res[m][n];
    }
}
